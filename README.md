#Jazz Standards Extractor

Motivation: to extract as a .csv (or whatever) file, the list of the top 1000 jazz standards on [http://jazzstandards.com].

[This](http://www.jazzstandards.com/compositions/index.htm) is the first (of 10) pages of the site that contains what we want.

The data is in a straightforward HTML table, we will extract it with Beautiful Soup 4.

So far, we can get csv out of a downloaded version of this first page.

Next steps:

* to get it straight off the web (Done 08.11.2016)
* to navigate to the next 9 pages, and extract each page
